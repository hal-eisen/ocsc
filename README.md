I worked as an instructor at OCSC for 12 years: 1997 through 2009. I was
teaching Basic Keelboat I and II, as well as Basic Cruising I and II. I
used to administer PT (Practical Tests) occasionally, sometimes taugh
on-shore classes, and very rarely filled in for a Bareboat Cruising PT.

OCSC was either the best or second best sailing school in the country
for many years. I was always inspired by Anthony Sandberg and Rich
Jepsen. To this day, the leadership example set by Rich is one that I
use in my normal job as a software engineering executive. I learned
an amazing amount from my time working at the club, and I'll always be 
grateful.

Given that [OCSC](https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10158105997317992&id=21197502991&set=a.324669847991)
closed its doors in 2021, I felt that the awesome
materials should not be lost to the mists of time. This repo is intended
to help sailors to grow and become more capable.
